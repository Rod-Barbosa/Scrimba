- Use class instead of h2 is for easier maintenance in the future
- class can be used for other things like footer for example. And who knows? Maybe we will use an h2 that isn't a subheading
```css
.subheading {
    color: #FCD801;
    background-color: #281B2D;
    font-size: 48px;
    border-bottom: 5px solid #00C54C;
    padding: 15px 20px;
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
```
